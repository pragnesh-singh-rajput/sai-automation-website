## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep slate (#2E2E2E) to reflect the industrial aesthetic. The hue aligns with the theme of precision, but it is neither a cliche bright metallic silver, nor the overly-used teal.
- Background color: Light gray (#F4F4F4) providing a subtle, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#F57C00) to highlight calls to action and important elements.
- Headings: Orbitron, for a techno/industrial look.
- Body: Inter or Roboto, prioritizing a professional and easy-to-read format.
- Crisp and clear icons from Lucide or Heroicons to enhance navigation.
- Fluid, CNC-machine like transitions and hover effects to enhance user experience.
